To confirm that the file exists: ls

While still in Command Mode, gg (lowercase) characters: the cursor moves to the first line of the file
G (uppercase) character: the cursor moves to the last line of the file.
Select dd: To delete a line

nano linux-distributions.txt

Select Ctrl O to save your changes and then select Enter.
Select Ctrl X to exit the Nano text editor.

On CentOS 7, Select Accessories, and then select Text Editor to open the Gedit text editor.
Select the Open menu and then type the linux-distributions.txt file name to open the file with the Gedit text editor.

Append to linux-distributions.txt text file: distrowatch.com - a good place from which to download Linux distributions


- Back up and restore files by using tar and cpio
mkdir data
cd data
touch fileA fileB fileC

To back up the files by using tar: tar -cf backup.tar f*
To confirm that the backup.tar file exists: ls
To simulate the loss of your data: rm f*
To restore the files by using tar: tar -xf backup.tar
Observe that the three files have been restored: ls

To back up and restore the same files: ls f* | cpio -o > backup.cpio
To simulate the loss of your data: rm f*
To restore the files by using cpio: cpio -iv < backup.cpio
ls


- Manage files and directories
Creating and deleting directories/files, copying/moving/viewing files

To change to the home directory: cd
To display your current location in the filesystem: pwd

mkdir salesdata
cd salesdata
touch file1 file2 file3

To create a subdirectory named July inside the salesdata directory: mkdir July
ls

To move the file1 to the July directory: mv file1 July
To copy the file2 file to the July directory: cp file2 July
To delete file3: rm file3

To confirm the above: ls
ls July

To display the contents of the current directory with various information: ls -a
ls -l
ls -la

To delete the July directory and all of its contents: rm -R July
ls


- Manage storage
Get root privileges by using sudo su - root
To display information about storage on the system: cat /proc/partitions
lsblk
blkid

To display partition information by using fdisk: fdisk -l /dev/sda

To open fdisk to create a new partition on /dev/sda: fdisk /dev/sda

Select the m option in fdisk to display the menu of available options.
p: to display the current partition information.
n: to create a new partition.
e: to create a new extended partition ?

Select Enter to accept the first sector.
Select Enter to accept the last sector.

Select p to display the current partition information and observe the new partition at the bottom of the list.
w: to save the changes to the partition table.

To update the partition information: partprobe

To display information about storage on the system, including the new sda4 partition: cat /proc/partitions
lsblk


- Configure links
Links permit users to access data from different parts of the filesystem.

To create a new file by using Vim: vim original.txt
Link Test Document

cat original.txt

To create a hard link to the original.txt file: ln /root/original.txt /tmp/hardlink.txt
To display the contents of the hardlink.txt file: cat /tmp/hardlink.txt

To create a symbolic link to the original.txt file: ln -s /root/original.txt /tmp/symlink.txt
To display the contents of the symlink.txt file: cat /tmp/symlink.txt

To display the contents of the /tmp directory and then observe that the symlink.txt file points to the /root/original.txt file: ls -l /tmp


- Use the find command
The find command searches the actual filesystem, while the locate command uses an index database to search for files.

To verify that your pwd is the root user's home directory: cd ~

To create a file that can be searched for by using find: touch /tmp/FindMe.txt

To search for the /tmp/FindMe.txt file by using the find command: find /tmp -iname findme.txt

To search for files owned by root by using the find command and the root owner name: find /tmp -user root

To search for files owned by root and then filtering the results for .txt files: find /tmp -user root | grep .txt


- Configure standard permissions
Standard Linux permissions are configured by using the chmod command. The command accepts permissions in two formats: Symbolic mode and Absolute modes.

To verify that your present working directory is the root user's home directory: cd ~
mkdir permissions
cd permissions

mkdir DirA
touch file1

To display the current permissions for DirA and file1: ls -l

* Run the ls -l command after each of the following steps to display the permissions changes you have made.

To grant the execute permission to user01 for file1 by using Symbolic mode: chmod u+x file1

To remove the read and execute permissions to others for DirA by using Symbolic mode: chmod o-rx DirA
Use the -v option with the chmod command to display the changes made.

To grant the read, write, and execute permissions to the owner and group identities, and remove all permissions for others to file1 by using Absolute mode: chmod 770 file1

To grant the read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and no access to group and others for DirA by using Absolute mode: chmod 700 DirA

Standard permissions only allow to configure permissions for 3 identities: user (owner), group, and all others.


- Configure ACL permissions
Access Control Lists permit Linux administrators to configure permissions for more than one user and one group. ACLs overcome the limitations of standard permissions.

To verify that your present working directory is the /root/permissions directory: cd ~/permissions

To display the current ACL for the file1 file: getfacl file1

You should see permissions set only for the root user account and for the root group.

To create a new group named "auditors": groupadd auditors

To configure an ACL that grants the read permission to the auditors group for file1: setfacl -m g:auditors:r-- /root/permissions/file1

To display the updated ACL for the file1 file: getfacl file1
You should see permissions set only for the root user account, for the root group, and for the auditors group.


- Configure advanced permissions
cd

To create a directory named /projects: mkdir /projects

To set a combination of the Sticky Bit and the SGID special permissions on the /projects directory and its contents by using Absolute mode: chmod -R 3766 /projects

To display the changes to the permissions for the /projects directory: ls -ld /projects

When you run the ls -ld /projects command, your output should include drwxrwSrwT for the directory. This output indicates the SGID and Sticky Bit permissions have been set for the directory.

To create a simulated script file named script.sh: touch /projects/script.sh

To set the SUID special permission on the script.sh file in the /projects directory by using Symbolic Mode: chmod u+s /projects/script.sh

When you run the ls -l /projects command, your output should include rwS for the user permissions. This output indicates the SUID permission has been set for the file.

* Used Vim, Nano, and Gedit to edit text files
* Backed up and restored files by using tar and cpio
* Managed files and directories
* Configured links
* Searched for files by using the find command
* Configured standard, ACL, and advanced permissions
